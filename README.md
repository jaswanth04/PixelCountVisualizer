# PixelCountVisualizer

A python package used to count the pixels in a given image or video

## Introduction

Finding the intensities of pixels is very necessary during analysis phase of computer vision. In such cases, it is very difficult to see the image and count visualization side by side.

Using this tool, we can see the image and the count visualization side by side.

This can also be used on a video, where you get a slider and as you move the slider, you can look at corresponding change in the Pixel Counts

## Usage

Install the module first

    pip install <TBD>

Find an example in trial.py

## TODO

As of now, it only visualizes RGB pixel count, we need to modify the code so, that it can support visualization for HSV, and YCbCr
