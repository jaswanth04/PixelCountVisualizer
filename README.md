# PixelCountVisualizer

A python package used to count the pixels in a given image or video

## Introduction

Finding the intensities of pixels is very necessary during analysis phase of computer vision. In such cases, it is very difficult to see the image and count visualization side by side.

Using this tool, we can see the image and the count visualization side by side.

This can also be used on a video, where you get a slider and as you move the slider, you can look at corresponding change in the Pixel Counts

## Usage

install the below packages

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
```

Find examples in tests/trial.py

Sample test data is used, which needs to be replaced with the required videos.
